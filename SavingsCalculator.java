/*
Savings Calculator

Write a function that returns the anticipated future value based on an accountâ€™s 
present value, interest rate, and time. 
The formula for simple future value is: FV = PV * [1 + (rate x time) ] 
(Note that rate is given in %; you will need to covert to the 
decimal). 

savings(20000, 4.5, 15)
RESULT:    33500
